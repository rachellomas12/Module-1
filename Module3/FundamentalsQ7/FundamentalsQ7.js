// 7. The following object represents a basketball game and keeps track of the score as the
// game progresses.
// a) Modify each of the methods so that they can be ‘chained’ together and the last line of
// the example code works
// b) Add a new method to print the full time final score
// c) Add a new object property to keep track of the number of fouls and a method to
// increment it, similar but separate to the score. Include the foul count in the half time and
// full time console messages
// d) Test your object by chaining all the method calls together in different combinations.
